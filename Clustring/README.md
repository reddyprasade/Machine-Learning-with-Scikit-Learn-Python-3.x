## Cluster analysis
***
* Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). 
* It is a main task of exploratory data mining, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning.
* Cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved. 
* It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. 
* Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. 
* Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. 
* The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings (including parameters such as the distance function to use, a density threshold or the number of expected clusters) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results. 
* Cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task, but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi-objective optimization that involves trial and failure. 
* It is often necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties.
* Besides the term clustering, there are a number of terms with similar meanings, including automatic classification, numerical taxonomy, botryology (from Greek βότρυς "grape"), typological analysis, and community detection. 
* The subtle differences are often in the use of the results: while in data mining, the resulting groups are the matter of interest, in automatic classification the resulting discriminative power is of interest.
