### Unsupervised learning
* Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision. 
* In contrast to supervised learning that usually makes use of human-labeled data, unsupervised learning, also known as self-organization allows for modeling of probability densities over inputs. 
* It forms one of the three main categories of machine learning, along with supervised and reinforcement learning. 
* Semi-supervised learning, a related variant, makes use of supervised and unsupervised techniques.
